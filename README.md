# Questionary

A self-study flashcard web application built with Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and SQLite.

You are shown a question, draft your response mentally, reveal the official answer, and mark it as success or failure. Skipped questions cycle back. Progress is tracked per question until you reset or start fresh.

---

## Features

- **Quiz mode** — one question at a time with a draft textarea
- **Answer reveal** — submit your draft, then reveal the official answer and mark success/fail
- **Failed-only mode** — toggle to cycle through only previously failed questions
- **Skip** — move to the next unanswered question without marking
- **Progress bar** — tracks answered vs. remaining questions
- **Admin page** — import questions from a `.txt` file; search/filter by text or status; edit or delete individual questions; reset or delete all
- **Persistent status** — success/fail status saved in SQLite; draft text is never stored

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 21+
- Maven 3.8+

### Run

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Open `http://localhost:8080/admin` to import questions, then `http://localhost:8080/quiz` to start.

### Build a JAR

```bash
mvn package -DskipTests
java -jar target/questionary-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The SQLite database file `questionary.db` is created automatically in the working directory.

## Question File Format

Questions are imported from plain `.txt` files:

```
#What is the capital of France?
Paris is the capital of France.
It has been the capital since medieval times.

#What is the chemical symbol for water?
H2O — two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom.

@This line is a comment and will be ignored

#What does CPU stand for?
Central Processing Unit.
It is the primary component that executes instructions in a computer.
```

**Rules:**
- A line starting with `#` begins a new question (the `#` is stripped from the text)
- Lines below (until the next `#` line) are the official answer
- A line starting with `@` is a comment and is ignored
- Blank lines are ignored and used as visual separators
